## 📌 Overview

**TheQBarber** is a digital solution that helps barbershops manage their walk-ins and appointments with ease. It lets customers join the queue online, view live wait times, and get notified when it’s their turn — all without needing to download an app.

For barbers and shop owners, it provides a simple dashboard to keep track of customers, reduce wait-time complaints, and run the shop more efficiently.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Customers visit the site and join the queue or book an appointment.
2. The shop admin (barber) sees the updated list in a dashboard.
3. As the barber serves customers, they mark them as "next" or "complete".
4. The next customer is automatically notified when it’s their turn.
